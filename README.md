# Ticket Booking Application

## Project Title & Description

This project is a ticket booking application built in Java, inspired by a YouTube tutorial. It allows users to book tickets for trains.

## Key Features & Benefits

-   **User Management:**  Allows the creation and management of user accounts.
-   **Train Management:**  Provides functionality to add, view, and manage trains.
-   **Ticket Booking:**  Enables users to book tickets for available trains.
-   **Simple Architecture:** Easy-to-understand Java project structure for maintainability.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

-   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have a JDK (version 8 or higher) installed.
-   **Gradle:** The project uses Gradle as a build tool.  It is recommended to have Gradle installed or to use the Gradle wrapper included in the project.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arvindoffical/ticketbooking.git
    cd ticketbooking
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ticket-Booking-java/app
    ```

3.  **Build the Project using Gradle:**

    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```

    *Note: If you do not have Gradle installed globally, the Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`) will download the required version.*

4.  **Run the Application:**

    After building, you can execute the main class directly, or create a JAR file for deployment.  The entry point is within the `ticket.booking` package.  Example command line execution (adjust path to your compiled classes):

    ```bash
    java -cp build/classes/java/main ticket.booking.App
    ```

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

The application uses a class structure for its core operations.

**Example:**

```java
// Example of creating and using a Train object
Train train = new Train("ExpressTrain", "CityA", "CityB", 200);
System.out.println("Train Name: " + train.getName());
```

**Core Components:**

-   `Train`: Represents a train with properties like name, origin, destination, and capacity.
-   `User`: Represents a user account.
-   `Ticket`: Represents a booked ticket with details about the user and train.
-   `TrainService`:  Manages train-related operations, such as adding or searching for trains.
-   `UserBookingService`: Handles user booking functionality.
-   `App`: Main application class (entry point).
